# icinga2-ansible
Under development.

This project contains a set of ansible playbooks and tasks for Icinga 2.x installation and configuration. The main idea is to exploit Ansible inventory and use it as a topology provider for dynamically building Icinga's host and groups configuration files. These configs can later be used in conjuction with Icinga 2 new cool feature called "apply rules" for checks assignment.
